This is a repository that contains weight data files exported from pre-trained
pix2pix models. These data files are supported in the [pix2pix-tensorflow] web
demo and [Unity Pix2Pix].

## How these models are trained?

These models are trained with using [Google Colaboratory], which is a free
Jupyter notebook environment with GPU acceleration. I wrote some helper
notebooks that are available from here: [Colaboratory Notebooks for pix2pix].
